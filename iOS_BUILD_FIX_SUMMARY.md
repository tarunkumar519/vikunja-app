# iOS Build Fix Summary - CocoaPods Issue

## Problem
The iOS build workflow failed during CocoaPods installation with the error:
```
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "cupertino_http":
  In Podfile:
    cupertino_http (from `.symlinks/plugins/cupertino_http/darwin`)

Specs satisfying the `cupertino_http (from `.symlinks/plugins/cupertino_http/darwin`)` dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.
```

## Root Cause
There was a mismatch between the iOS deployment targets:
- **Xcode project file (`ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`)**: Set to iOS 8.0
- **Podfile (`ios/Podfile`)**: Set to iOS 12.0
- **cupertino_http plugin**: Requires iOS 12.0 or later

## Solution Applied
Updated the iOS deployment target in the Xcode project file from 8.0 to 12.0 to match the Podfile configuration:

### Changes made:
1. **File**: `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
   - Changed `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 8.0;` to `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 12.0;` (2 occurrences)

### Files already correctly configured:
- **`ios/Podfile`**: Already has `platform :ios, '12.0'`
- **Post-install hooks**: Already set deployment target to 12.0 for all pods

## Next Steps
The iOS build workflow should now successfully complete the CocoaPods installation step. The deployment target is now consistently set to iOS 12.0 across all configurations, which meets the requirements of the `cupertino_http` plugin and other dependencies.

## Additional Notes
- Flutter officially supports iOS 12 and later as of the current stable release
- The `cupertino_http` plugin (version 2.0.2) requires iOS 12.0 or later
- All other iOS-related configurations in the project are already compatible with iOS 12.0
