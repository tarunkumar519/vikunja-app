# Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Android Flavor Mismatch - CRITICAL**
**Problem**: The `Makefile` was trying to build with `--flavor main` but only `unsigned` and `production` flavors exist in the Android `build.gradle` configuration.

**Fix**: Updated `Makefile` line 18:
```diff
- $(FLUTTER) build apk --release --build-number=$(VERSION) --flavor main
+ $(FLUTTER) build apk --release --build-number=$(VERSION) --flavor production
```

**Impact**: This was likely causing all Android release builds to fail in both GitHub Actions and Drone CI.

### 2. **Deprecated GitHub Actions**
**Problem**: Using deprecated `actions/setup-java@v1` which may cause build failures.

**Fix**: Updated both `.github/workflows/flutter.yml` and `.github/workflows/flutter-release.yml`:
```diff
- uses: actions/setup-java@v1
+ uses: actions/setup-java@v4
  with:
-   java-version: '17.x'
+   java-version: '17'
+   distribution: 'temurin'
```

**Impact**: The deprecated action could cause inconsistent behavior or eventual failure as GitHub phases out v1 actions.

## Current Build Configuration Status

### Android Builds
- ✅ **Fixed**: Flavor mismatch resolved
- ✅ **Fixed**: Java setup action updated
- ✅ **Good**: Android builds have `continue-on-error: true` to prevent blocking workflows
- ✅ **Good**: Both `unsigned` and `production` flavors properly configured

### iOS Builds
- ✅ **Good**: Comprehensive CocoaPods retry logic
- ✅ **Good**: Proper code signing setup with Fastlane
- ✅ **Good**: Separate unsigned and signed build jobs
- ✅ **Good**: Export options properly configured

### Available Build Commands
- `make build-debug` - Debug APK with unsigned flavor
- `make build-release` - Release APK with production flavor (now fixed)
- `make build-profile` - Profile APK with unsigned flavor
- `make build-ios` - iOS build without code signing
- `make build-all` - All Android builds

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### GitHub Actions
1. **PR/Push to non-main branches**: 
   - Android debug builds should work
   - iOS unsigned IPA generation should work
   - Linting and formatting checks should pass

2. **Push to main branch**:
   - Android release builds should work with production flavor
   - iOS signed IPA generation and TestFlight upload should work (if secrets configured)

### Drone CI
1. **Testing pipeline**: Debug builds should work
2. **Release pipelines**: Release builds should work with correct flavor
3. **iOS pipeline**: Should work with updated dependencies

## Required Secrets (for iOS signing)
- `MATCH_PASSWORD` - Fastlane Match password
- `FASTLANE_PASSWORD` - Apple ID password  
- `FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` - App-specific password
- `FASTLANE_SESSION` - Fastlane session token
- `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` - Keychain password
- Contact info secrets for TestFlight

## Next Steps
1. Test the builds with the fixed configuration
2. Monitor workflow runs for any remaining issues
3. Update any remaining deprecated actions if found
4. Consider updating Flutter version constraint in pubspec.yaml to match workflow usage

## Files Modified
- `Makefile` - Fixed Android flavor for release builds
- `.github/workflows/flutter.yml` - Updated Java setup action
- `.github/workflows/flutter-release.yml` - Updated Java setup action
