# iOS Build Workflow Analysis

## Current Workflow Status

Based on the GitHub API response, here's the current status of iOS builds:

### Recent Workflow Runs

1. **üîÑ CURRENTLY RUNNING** - Build iOS IPA #12 (main branch)
   - **Run ID**: 16309499962
   - **Status**: `in_progress`
   - **Trigger**: Push to main branch after PR #5 merge
   - **Commit**: `d37c342` - "Merge pull request #5 from tarunkumar519/cursor/fix-ios-pod-install-dependency-issues-634f"
   - **URL**: https://github.com/tarunkumar519/vikunja-app/actions/runs/16309499962

2. **‚ùå RECENT FAILURE** - Build iOS IPA #11 (PR branch)
   - **Run ID**: 16308970191
   - **Status**: `completed`
   - **Conclusion**: `failure`
   - **Trigger**: Pull request on branch "cursor/fix-ios-pod-install-dependency-issues-634f"
   - **Commit**: `9948a95` - "Update iOS deployment target from 12.0 to 13.0"
   - **URL**: https://github.com/tarunkumar519/vikunja-app/actions/runs/16308970191

3. **‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL** - Flutter Build #11 (same PR branch)
   - **Run ID**: 16308970181
   - **Status**: `completed`
   - **Conclusion**: `success`
   - **Same commit as the failed iOS build**

## Key Findings

### 1. iOS vs Flutter Build Disparity
- **Flutter builds are succeeding** while **iOS builds are failing** on the same commit
- This suggests the issue is specifically with iOS build configuration, not with the Flutter app code itself

### 2. Recent iOS Deployment Target Changes
- Recent commit updated iOS deployment target from 12.0 to 13.0
- This change was part of attempts to fix CocoaPods compatibility issues
- Current Podfile shows `platform :ios, '13.0'`

### 3. iOS Build Configuration Analysis

#### Current Podfile Configuration:
```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
ENV['COCOAPODS_DISABLE_STATS'] = 'true'
ENV['ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING'] = 'NO'
```

#### Post-install Configuration:
- User script sandboxing disabled for all targets
- Minimum deployment target set to 13.0
- Code signing disabled for CI builds
- Architecture set to arm64 only

### 4. Historical Issues Addressed
Based on the fix summary files, previous issues included:
- ‚úÖ CocoaPods deployment target mismatches (iOS 8.0 vs 12.0 vs 13.0)
- ‚úÖ User script sandboxing errors in CI environments
- ‚úÖ Xcode project configuration inconsistencies
- ‚úÖ Export options and entitlements configuration
- ‚úÖ Fastlane Match configuration for code signing

## Likely Current Issues

### 1. iOS 13.0 Deployment Target Impact
The recent change to iOS 13.0 might have introduced new compatibility issues:
- Some Flutter plugins may not support iOS 13.0 minimum
- Pod specifications may need updating
- Xcode project files may need manual updates

### 2. Potential CocoaPods Issues
Common patterns that could cause current failures:
- Pod dependency resolution with iOS 13.0 requirement
- Plugin compatibility with the new deployment target
- Cache invalidation needed after deployment target change

### 3. GitHub Actions Environment Issues
- macOS runner compatibility with iOS 13.0 builds
- Xcode version compatibility
- Flutter stable channel compatibility with iOS 13.0

## Build Pipeline Analysis

### Current iOS Build Workflow (.github/workflows/ios-build.yml):
1. **Setup Phase**: Xcode, Flutter, CocoaPods update
2. **Dependency Phase**: Flutter pub get, CocoaPods install (with retry logic)
3. **Build Phase**: Flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
4. **Package Phase**: Create unsigned IPA
5. **Sign Phase**: Fastlane signing and TestFlight upload (main branch only)

### Drone CI Configuration:
- Uses macOS runner for iOS builds
- Includes CocoaPods repo update
- Integrates with Fastlane for deployment
- Configured for main branch pushes

## Recommendations

### 1. Check Current Build Status
The currently running build (#12) will show if the iOS 13.0 deployment target fix resolved the issues.

### 2. Examine Specific Failure Logs
To get detailed error information, check the logs for run #16308970191:
```
https://github.com/tarunkumar519/vikunja-app/actions/runs/16308970191
```

### 3. Potential Quick Fixes
If the current build (#12) still fails:

#### Option A: Revert to iOS 12.0
```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0'
```

#### Option B: Update Xcode Project Files
Ensure all Xcode project files match the 13.0 deployment target:
```
ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
```

#### Option C: Clean CocoaPods Cache
The workflow already includes cache cleaning, but manual verification may be needed.

### 4. Next Steps
1. **Monitor the current build** (#12) to see if it completes successfully
2. **Check specific error logs** from the failed build to identify the exact failure point
3. **Verify plugin compatibility** with iOS 13.0 deployment target
4. **Consider gradual rollback** if iOS 13.0 causes widespread compatibility issues

## Build Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ CocoaPods installation completes without errors
- ‚úÖ Flutter iOS build completes successfully
- ‚úÖ IPA file is generated correctly
- ‚úÖ Fastlane signing process works (for main branch)
- ‚úÖ TestFlight upload succeeds (for main branch)
